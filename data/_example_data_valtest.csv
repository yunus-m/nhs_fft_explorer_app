Suffered breakdown 14 months before having terrible suicidal thoughts for months, not controlled or treated well by GP. Saw the nurse at Heather close. Explained how I felt. Advised me to go on a walk, and when I said ""what do I do if I feel I can't keep myself safe"" said ""just keep busy"". I saw a specialist prescriber there at the same time. Asked him to review and change my medication, as clearly making me unwell. Expected a service. Was referred back to my GP. A week later I was no better and felt so unwell with dark thoughts, I rang the crisis team at Millbrook outpatients, who saw me the next day, stopped my medication. Started me on a suitable medicine. Within three months I'm back at work, working as a nurse. What was the point of having a prescriber at Heather close if he was not willing to help me, like the crisis team ended up having to do.  Local mentality team is a waste of time and money, and needs looking at why that happened. I have a young family and wonder how many others get turned away. Very scary."

Someone with no medical knowledge so cant even have a guess at what is causing them to feel unwell waits an hour and a half to get through to 111. Then instead of being able to use their instincts, the ticky box of queationsnis gone through. Advice hiven or the standard someone will ring back in iup to 2 hrs but if symptoms get worse. Patient therefore puts phone down and waits for the call but after an hour starts to feel much worse, say for example its (sepsis) but call ahdnker didnt pik up on it ticky box way, so patient does what they are told because they are feeling worse so they ring 111 back and wait in a call queue again for an hour and 20 mins but by the time the call handler at 111 takes the call the patient cant really string wodss together so call handler by this point makes it an urgent 999 ambulance despatch.However after the hour and a half wait to get through first time plus the hour wait for a medical pro to ring back and another hour and a bit wait to get back through to 111 the persons Selsis has turned to Septic shock, very hard to comenout of alive or without life changing effects.So there is my opinion of how in sone ways 111 is not fit fir purpose.Great in what it does, but the way 1q1 works it also costs lives."

I had to insist to final paramedic call handler that his condition may have been terminal but at that moment in time there had been no indication either to myself or professional medical team involved in his care to make us believe he was dying that day.  Even if he had been he was in severe pain they could hear him and felt they treat him worse than an animal leaving it so long before they agreed to send an ambulance.  I believe I made the first call between 7-8 and the ambulance wasn’t despatched u til after midnight.  If i had been able to move him I would have put him in car and taken there by myself.  I actually received this text today whilst sitting with the registrar registering his death.  I will always believe this delay and the trauma he suffered weakened him so much he died earlier than he may have done otherwise.  I will also always be haunted by the fact everyone seemed  to work  from a script and there was no scope for clinical judgement or common sense or actually humanity"

Unable to adjust to the ‘must ask the questions as written down’ top down directive when dealing with a relative supporting a deaf 90 year old suffering from delirium. Plus the end of call list of do’s and don’ts was information overload more suited to a follow-up text. Clearly 999 staff have no front line knowledge or experience.

2268,NEAS 111 2363 - Q2,NEAS,NEAS 111 2363,19/07/2022,111,,2,How could we improve?,"I had contacted NHS111 to ask about symptoms in the night, they told me I must be seen by my GP the same day, and that they would notify the practice. When I called Parkway Medical they had no record of this, and that NHS111 should have booked for me, so couldn’t give me a GP check and to go to a walk-in centre. As I had previously been admitted on an antibiotic drip for two days from RVI ambulatory care with the same symptoms, and had been told to be seen the same day by the GP, I was surprised the NHS111 had not notified the surgery. I called NHS111 to check if they had contacted the GP and that if I went to a walkin centre that they would have the necessary info from my call, and was told they would contact me. A person called back who informed me that this was just an emergency service, of which I am very aware, and had not requested a call back, just wanting to know if the info would be sent, as so far it had not been. The GP practice subsequently mentioned that they do not always receive notifications of calls, even for the same day so this had meant I had waited until the GP practice opened before being told to travel some distance to the walkin centre. I understood the service was to be used if the GP practice was not open and I had been following NHS directions to ring if GP practice not open and I was puzzled as to why NHS111 had not informed the GP to enable a same day examination as suggested. I went to a walkin centre and was sent to hospital again, subsequently seeing a consultant. There seems to be a lack of communication between NHS111 and GP practice, and the GP practice has a tendency to overuse NHS111 telling me to ring 111 when I merely ring for a GP appointment. This puts pressure on NHS111, whose call handlers have a difficult job."

They were amazing and I felt reassured that my husband was in good hands.The contracted out ambulance staff who attended on 23rd feb 2022 were abrupt and appeared reluctant to help. Some more patient care and communication with the patient, explaining why they wanted him to move when in severe pain and struggling to breathe and how they believed it would help him would have been better received rather than my husband struggling to utter the words “help me” and two staff just standing watching him. They seemed very uneasy when a family member showed up who was actually NEAS staff. They did not interfere with the ambulance staff but did try to get them to take my husbands medication to which they refused, which surprised my family member given the medication. They said it was just a panic attack, despite having a temperature and being deathly white in colour. Thankfully he got better care in the hospital. "

I was referred to by someone from PTS, and was misled into thinking it was further therapy for my post-natal depression. On [Date Redacted] I had an initial assessment with a junior doctor, which I had waited 2 months for. She asked me questions about my life and I told her a lot, believing that it was therapy. I spoke for an hour, and during the session I was made to feel like I didn't have post natal depression. I was told by this doctor that all the events in my life was just making me feel sad. I was and I am still, having suicidal thoughts every single day and my mood has changed drastically since giving birth. I have never felt so low in my entire life, but for some reason this was downplayed by the junior doctor, and I felt belittled. At the end of the session she asked me if I was willing to take medication, and I said no. She then told me that she can't help me because all they do there is medicate people, and that they don't do therapy. I don't understand why she made me pour my heart out for an hour, and talk about my life, if at the end of the day she just wanted me to take her drugs. I was deeply upset and disappointed with this service. It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I went home in tears feeling 100 times worse than when I got there. Please can you educate your junior doctors on what post natal depression is, and how hormonal imbalance can really affect your mood, in which some women can have depression, some can even have psychosis and commit suicide. It is serious and not something that should be downplayed. I was told that I would be referred back to pts, but I still have not heard anything from anyone.
