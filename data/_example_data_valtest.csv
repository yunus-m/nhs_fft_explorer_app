1366,what_good,I don't know. The DRC staff are good with us tho.
4780,could_improve,"So let down. I understand the pandemic has disrupted services but this shouldn't alter the amount of group therapy given. Using the pandemic as an excuse to cut out months at the end of my group therapy because you thought I needed support then rather than later, is unacceptable. I wasn't given the option to make the decision for myself in my care. I had no choice I had to take the phone calls. If I had the choice I would've waited for group therapy to start rather than having to take one to one phone calls, as part of my group therapy time scale. If I was told that those phone calls would be taken off the end of my group therapy, and if I was given the choice I would've waited for group to start. Those phone calls really should've been classed as support calls rather than group MBT. I have waited years for this personalised therapy, I only get one chance in my lifetime to access it. Yet you have cut my time short by months. I now have to sit in group therapy listening to my therapist say to the new starters that they will have a ""full year of group therapy to explore their difficulties."" Hearing those words was like a dagger to my heart. You chose to end my therapy on fri 13th, the most unlucky day of the year. Also 3 days before my birthday. I also found out that I'm the first person to leave the group even though we all started together. Do you know how that all feels? Obviously no, thought has gone in to thinking about the individual, me. How all this would make me feel. I was also told I was going to get an Autism assessment. I've not heard anything so I guess this is no longer going ahead. I was told this assessment would help see if I have Autism or other mental health disorders, as it is looking like I have more than BPD. Now I feel all this research has stopped because of how soon you are making me leave, as there is not enough time now. I had high hopes for getting the treatment time needed but you didn't give it me. You can't alter treatment because of a pandemic especially when this treatment is a one off access. I understand that the pandemic put a hold on things that's fine, but to take away group therapy time is unacceptable."
7762,nonspecific,Ensured that the call had been within the specified time frame or give a more accurate time frame.

601,nonspecific,"Arrived 25 minutes. Calmed me down, took excellent care of my husband who had obviously had a stroke.

2522,what_good,Treated me with respect. Caring and understanding.
2611,could_improve,"My partner's nurse has been awful, and not supportive to either of us. We have had more support with the duty workers, when we have called to speak to them. Although not all of them have been great. Sometimes we just feel like we are going through a tick box exercise, so they can evidence contact, but if the contact doesn't help, then the whole experience is pointless."

6017,could_improve,My problem was resolved very quick and satisfactory.
2431,could_improve,"Nothing, all good."
5470,what_good,"Without the support of our disability learning nurse, we would still be struggling to get appointments needed for our daughter at hospitals and with the GP. The disability nurse also put us in touch with an O.T. team to help with rehousing, which has been very sucessful. The nurse also provided us with an assessment for rehousing, from her perspective, which helped the council approve our priority for housing."
4128,could_improve,There was nothing wrong with the service everyone was very professional
6974,what_good,Everything! You've really got to know me and have changed my life for the better.
1552,could_improve,"Dental appointments - there should be some sort of EMERGENCY treatments for those people are really and truly in pain.

650,could_improve,Na
1432,what_good,Visits from 'experts' - I've already met the debt management team. Team for going above and beyond in their care - also their knowledge about systems/organisations to help. Time to talk with other carers.

7733,nonspecific,I had 999 out twice that day within hours l thought the first visit my Dad should have been admitted it was only on the second call he was taken into hospital he was dehydrated and quite poorly
4869,could_improve,These sessions helped my coping strategies with worrys. I think these skills would really help other people around my age and could really benefit them (even if they're not going through anything at the moment).
676,could_improve,Nothing could have been improved.

6724,nonspecific,Took too long to get the info across to the operator who insisted on speaking to the patient when the operator had been told that the patient was having difficulty communicating. When the ambulance crew arrived I think they should have got a second crew a

4219,nonspecific,They were very helpful. Friendly.put me at ease. And very good taking me to hospital
3963,could_improve,"Understandably delay's can not be avoided, however I had a recent MI and had a stent. I was presenting cardiac symptoms similar to previous MI which prompted the call and it was a bit daunting the time it took for ambulance to arrive."

1834,what_good,Staff go the extra mile.
5248,could_improve,"The treatment takes too long, so you lose momentum, although I appreciate that could slowed everything down. The education classes are a bit limited and a bit basic, for eg, we'd benefit from on-line tutorials such as IT courses. The library could do with being linked to a public library service so we could request books & there would be some stock rotation. We could do with more opportunities for exercise and healthier food-fewer carbohydrates, less processed meat."

2727,could_improve,"The ongoing battle that you have to have, with the mental health side of things, are sole destroying. Nothing is easy or straight-forward and so time consuming, almost as if your made out to be lying all of the time, as if you not suffering enough already!!!"
7320,could_improve,"The paramedics kept talking to me, we had a laugh, as I was shaking. Very bad fall in garden. Smashed my head, broke 2 panes of glass. No blood, but big lump."
914,could_improve,"Just got to us earlier, tho we realise the problem is not with the ambulance service but caused by the public ringing for ambulances instead of getting to hospital themselves when this is possible"
5256,could_improve,Nothing comes to mind.
7737,nonspecific,Time taken of 16 minutes for a blue light emergency. Crew openly admitted waiting on Chinese. This Resulted in baby being delivered by family friend before arrival of professionals. Not giving father a chance to cut cord. Having to use 2nd crew as no othe

4319,nonspecific,Nothing they provide everything possible.
1285,could_improve,"Think of all ages not just the older generation. That is also in posters and helpful leaflets for patients and staff in all areas. Everything changes, you start with groups and good teams then you stop them or change them which is not good for someone with dementia."

4116,could_improve,Can't think of anything.
2282,nonspecific,Gave appropriate advice.
2004,could_improve,"Advice was inappropriate- 111 wanted to send an ambulance when I was just needing advice/antisickness/different antibiotics as I couldn't stop vomiting my antibiotics back up (bad chest infection, was given a second lot of antibiotics by gp as still very poorly, but could not keep them down and gp surgery then closed). I said no to the ambulance, it wasn't needed, but was asked to go to a&e. Wished that I was given the option of being able to speak to a clinician over 111 when I said that I didn't feel my condition was appropriate for ambulance nor a&e. Ended up having to go to a&e in the end as I needed the antibiotics to stay down and start working, I was vomiting my other medication back up, and no other options were available to me as 111 classed me as an emergency (I think because I was short of breath, but due to my chest infection?)"
7526,could_improve,Because the staff could not have done any better.
2370,could_improve,It took 30 minutes to connect with poor advice.

Did you follow the advice given by the 111 service?] Ticked - Yes some of it. - Comments: Got myself to hospital! [11. The treatment I received at the health service I was referred to was good.] Ticked : strongly disagree - Comments: 15 hour wait. Our NHS is dying."

253,nonspecific,Nothing everything was perfect
6977,could_improve,"I have always felt that I am a nuscence to the team. So when I ring up and ask for a call from duty, there is nothing worse than sitting waiting for a call that never comes. So now I don't bother contacting them however bad or distressed I feel. I also was led to believe they would liaise with GP about my meds, but this never happened. So I spoke to my GP myself and sorted it with him myself. I am now on a waiting list but it took me lots of calls to find out what I'm waiting for, and now I find it could take a year to materialise. The admin people in the team are the kindest and most helpful in the team, and they say I can call duty in the meantime, but if I do then I either get no call back (which just increases my distress) or the duty person says to ring the Samaritans or my GP. I don't think I will get any help from this team, so I am finding other ways to get help or help myself. I had such high hopes when I was referred. I liked the idea of everything I heard - it just never came to anything. The person I spoke to for my assessment gave me hope that they could help me, but it never materialised."
2959,nonspecific,"Made sure that connections were made.For example, I was told that a call back from my own GP was arranged. I waited until past the allotted time and then phoned my GP surgery myself who had no record of a call being booked.Similar happened when an appointment was booked for me at South Tyneside Hospital. When I arrived, they had no record of me being booked."
3664,could_improve,Overall care.

1387,what_good,Everything
7748,could_improve,More regular staff from IHTT would be good. Knowing discussions are recorded on notes can be a block. IHTT visit would be better if longer.

2640,what_good,My last 2 named nurses were good.
153,nonspecific,"Increase capacity or have transport for between hospitals only. even a car would have given me a better chance. I needed an emergency op and waited 4-5 hours to go from Cramlington to RVI. at one point I was asked if family member could come get me instead as it would be my best chance, very scary! Staff lovely and excellent service once it eventually arrived. RVI kept ringing to see where i was, which caused me anxiety and worry."
2536,what_good,"The ward are great at listening to you if you have a problem with a family member, while they are on the ward. They try to help as much as they can."
371,nonspecific,I don't think you can do better

We have found the service to cause a lot of upset and distress to both of us, as the care hasn't been good at all. I think we know more about the staff's personal lives than they do about ours. We are not interested in struggles they have had, what made them go into the job, house renovations etc. Perhaps put your patients first. That would be a good start. We will be putting in an official complaint as we don't seem to be getting anywhere."

607,nonspecific,Although the operator went through the check list with accuracy the patient was in a great deal of pain and I felt she was impatient. (The first time we called an ambulance it didn't come. Instead after waiting 4 hours a taxi was sent from Sunderland. The patient was in a great deal of pain. It was a long wait. The second time the ambulance came after about 3 hours and the paramedics did check him out before setting off but again it was a long time waiting. We take for granted the whole of the National Health and the ambulance service who at the end of the day can only do their best with the equipment ambulances they have at their disposal.
1482,what_good,I am lucky to have a psychiatrist visit me at home. All the team were highly professional; had empathy with me; boosted my confidence and were sensitive to my needs. They were amazing. I attribute my learning to walk again to their care and compassion. I will really miss them all and their sense of humour which kept me feeling positive.

2478,could_improve,"My wife has dementia, and I told the interviewer [Name Redacted] that she was having a bad day (which I don't think is unusual for someone with dementia). So because of that, [Name Redacted] said that she would not carry on with the assessment, and did not bother asking questions regarding the envelope that was sent with drawings etc that was to be opened on the day of the interview, and informed us that there would be no more contact and asked if we could be contacted by someone from an Alzheimer's group which we agreed to, this was on [Date Redacted] and we have not been contacted by anyone to this day [Date Redacted]. [Name Redacted] also indicated that she would report to our GP suggesting that a mild anti-depressant could be prescribed for my wife.

7770,nonspecific,It's always busy and I have no other place to go for help when GP is closed. I don't always have transport available so not easy to get myself to hospital. I was given stupid advice by the system. (As a type 1 diabetic I usually have a high BG when ill.
3060,nonspecific,Called back sooner
2363,nonspecific,I was told I would receive a call from a doctor within 1 hour. Then I got a call to say it would be hours and not. I waited 6 hours to speak to a doctor.

5267,could_improve,"Answering the phone sooner, or having more people available to answer the phone. I have been in a queue to talk to someone for over an hour and a half. I only want to book an appointment. I'm happy that I'm not in a crisis situation, where I need help and advice, because as a first time mum, I want the reassurance or plan of action quicker than an hour."
6639,nonspecific,"Professional, polite and attentive."

Asked him to review and change my medication, as clearly making me unwell. Expected a service. Was referred back to my GP. A week later I was no better and felt so unwell with dark thoughts, I rang the crisis team at Millbrook outpatients, who saw me the next day, stopped my medication. Started me on a suitable medicine. Within three months I'm back at work, working as a nurse. What was the point of having a prescriber at Heather close if he was not willing to help me, like the crisis team ended up having to do. Local mentality team is a waste of time and money, and needs looking at why that happened. I have a young family and wonder how many others get turned away. Very scary."

I was referred to by someone from PTS, and was misled into thinking it was further therapy for my post-natal depression. On [Date Redacted] I had an initial assessment with a junior doctor, which I had waited 2 months for. She asked me questions about my life and I told her a lot, believing that it was therapy. I spoke for an hour, and during the session I was made to feel like I didn't have post natal depression. I was told by this doctor that all the events in my life was just making me feel sad. I was and I am still, having suicidal thoughts every single day and my mood has changed drastically since giving birth. I have never felt so low in my entire life, but for some reason this was downplayed by the junior doctor, and I felt belittled. At the end of the session she asked me if I was willing to take medication, and I said no. She then told me that she can't help me because all they do there is medicate people, and that they don't do therapy. I don't understand why she made me pour my heart out for an hour, and talk about my life, if at the end of the day she just wanted me to take her drugs. I was deeply upset and disappointed with this service. It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I went home in tears feeling 100 times worse than when I got there. Please can you educate your junior doctors on what post natal depression is, and how hormonal imbalance can really affect your mood, in which some women can have depression, some can even have psychosis and commit suicide. It is serious and not something that should be downplayed. I was told that I would be referred back to pts, but I still have not heard anything from anyone. I feel let down, disappointed and even more depressed as a result."

5066,could_improve,"I had to wait too long for CBT therapy. I disagreed with the decision to take me in to hospital, while I was in hospital I made friends with other patients and engaged in physical activities, but the weekly ward rounds were only 20 minutes long and inadequate. The experience was pointless because no proper course of CBT was offered.

Care plans (nursing) are overly complicated/convoluted. Cross-sectoral/inter-agency working eg. with Arnold Lodge & the Assertive Transition service (ATS) is not seamless & communication is not smooth between organisation ot the detriment of patient care.

6755,could_improve,"The therapist was often very late to sessions, I would commonly be waiting 15-30 minutes for him to call me. On other occasions we would have a call scheduled in and I would be waiting but the call would never come. I would then hear nothing until the following week when our next appointment was due and he would behave as if nothing had happened. During the sessions the therapist often talked over me, he would ask me a question and then go off on a tangent and not allow me to get a word in. One of the main issues I had was that he didn't take my opinions into account, particularly concerning my ongoing treatment. I felt I was not ready to be discharged from the service but there was a continual pressure for me to do so. The therapist kept bringing this up in our sessions and eventually texted me to tell me that I was being discharged from the service despite my wishes. In the message he explained the reason for this being that he was under pressure from management due to an extensive waiting list, I feel this is an unacceptable reason to discharge someone still in need of support. Over all I feel the lack of care and poor communication has really affected my experience and that the delivery of this type of service should be monitored more closely. I still feel that I am struggling with issues I really need support with. I would like more therapy with a different practitioner, but have now been discharged from the service and and am unsure what my options are."

I was even told by one call taker that ""the anti viral team don't work weekends"". Firstly, there is no such team as the ""anti viral team"" and secondly, the meds could be dispensed over a weekend. Poor service which could make the difference between life/death/hospitalisation. What is point of having these meds available for patients like me, if the service doesn't recognise the importance of the dispensing of them being time critical, and training call taker staff to have actual knowledge of the scheme! I was left in tears several times out of sheer frustration at a time when I was really poorly, had very little energy & had difficulty talking/out of breath."

I was asked to attended Cramlington hospital at A&E. we didn't do this as my husband felt they wouldn't have the specialist help he needed. He also didn't want a fuss by going to A&E.I felt that there should be ambulances for those that need it, and not every patient was going to go to hospital without a prompt."

We all know what is going to happen after 6 months, they will say farewell you've been stable so you don't need the therapy. The system is appalling!

5037,what_good,Staff are exceptionally kind. there is no stigma or judgement even though criminal activity has been involved. Staff treat patients equally. Staff are responsive to needs. Staff are always available to talk to if you need it. Care is individualized and staff pay a huge amount of time into attending to details. Staff never appear impatient when they're asked to do things for you. Staff are friendly an caring.
4105,nonspecific,Overall the staff were very good my only concern was the time it took for the ambulance to arrive it was poor at 45 minutes for a heart problem
2564,could_improve,"Communicating when things are happening (eg when ward rounds have been scheduled for). These were communicated to my community team but not me. There were issues with staffing levels when I was on the ward, this impacted leave but also care in terms of people being familiar with patients/their care plans/the ward (or in the case of bank and agency staff often not being familiar with people and their care plans), and whether or not people were available for 1:1s, etc. When leave was denied, explaining why this was the case. Finding time to go through care plans with patients. A lot of the information that the psychiatrist initially had about me was several years out of date (eg who has CCo, etc). Sticking to the ward timetable (activities and community meetings etc didn¢, ""¢t often happen as planned, although often other activities happened). Helping people who are quieter in their distress, as well as those who¢, ""¢s distress is perhaps more outwardly apparent."
